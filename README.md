# [comm**Unity** Web App](http://community-chicago.herokuapp.com)
A community building app targeting refugee communities within Chicago and connecting them with local families to help facilitate a smoother transition. 

## Overview
Human interaction is vital to thriving communities. Our App helps refugee communities that have left their homes, to resettle in Chicago by rebuilding their communities and connecting them with local families. Personal interaction is key to their success in adopting Chicago as a home, and our APP helps make that happen.
